Make a game to learn how to code in javascript.

---

## Overview

### Goals
1. Learn how to code in Javascript.
2. Use my learning experience to help others learn.
3. Create something that others can use for their projects if they want to.

### Concept
Create a simple, stage-based beat-'em-up-style game with RPG elements. Enemies come in waves, and each stage must be cleared before moving on to the next.

### Philosophy
Create a modular system that encourages customization and extensibility. Allow people to use elements from the game engine inpdependently or create their own modules to extend the game.
